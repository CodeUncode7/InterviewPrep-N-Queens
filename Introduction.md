## Introduction: What is the N-Queens Problem?

The N-Queens problem is a fascinating puzzle in the world of computer science and mathematics. The objective is to place **N queens** on an **N x N chessboard** in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means:

1. No two queens can share the same row.
2. No two queens can share the same column.
3. No two queens can share the same diagonal.

For instance, the **8-Queens Problem** (N=8) is a popular variation where you aim to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard while satisfying these conditions. The problem can be generalized to any N.
